### Action 18 Technical Coordination Meeting Wendesday 18 febryuary tecnical meeting - Technical coordination meeting (T2.1–T2.3 alignment)
Date: 18 February 2026
- Action: Technical discussion held regarding alignment between T2.1 (Stakeholder Analysis) and T2.3 (Requirements Framework).
- Key Points Discussed:
- Proposal by Evaggelos Kafantaris to add a “Source” column in the stakeholder/requirements tracking file in order to improve traceability.
- ATH confirmed agreement to include the “Source” column to enhance transparency and requirement origin tracking.
- Clarification requested on whether outputs from T2.1 (e.g., stakeholder use cases and early insights) should directly feed into T2.3.
- Clarification Provided by ATH:
- Task 2.3 formal requirement consolidation will follow the structured methodology and timeline.
- However, early inputs from T2.1 (including potential use cases and stakeholder insights) may be preliminarily captured to support future requirements refinement.
- Outcome:
- Agreement to enable early information flow from T2.1 to T2.3 without formally triggering requirement validation before the defined T2.3 phase.

#### TODO : 
- share link of wp2 meeting 
- Do not launch interviews before consolidating questionnaire.
- Do not allow WP5 to start pilots before requirement traceability is clear.
- created WP2_Traceability_Matrix 
- add column 

### Action 19 👉 What is the difference between:
- “Use Case” (T2.1 output)
- “Requirement” (T2.3 output)
- Suggested positioning:
- T2.1 → collects stakeholder problems, needs, use cases
- T2.3 → transforms validated needs into structured, traceable requirements

#### Internal clarification – T2.1 vs T2.3
- T2.1 (Use Cases): Captures stakeholder problems, needs, and operational scenarios in a solution-agnostic manner.
- Purpose: Understand context, actors, and expectations before defining system obligations.
- T2.3 (Requirements): Converts validated needs and use cases into structured, traceable, and testable requirement statements.
- Purpose: Support prioritisation, technical alignment, and mapping to DETANGLE outputs and deliverables.
- Link: Use cases and stakeholder inputs from T2.1 serve as sources for T2.3 requirement formulation under the phased methodology.

### action 20 CREATED  WP2 internal governance tool.
- Its purpose is to:
- Link T2.1 → T2.2 → T2.3
- Ensure traceability for RP1
- Show reviewers how needs become requirements
- Protect ATH as WP2 lead
It is a WP2 internal governance tool. Its purpose is to: Link T2.1 → T2.2 → T2.3. Ensure traceability for RP1 . Show reviewers how needs become requirements. Protect ATH as WP2 lead. It is your control instrument. Who Should Fill It? You should define ownership clearly:
- Primary Owner:
- ATH (WP2 Lead)
- Contributors:
- ICERT → provides stakeholder input references
- Technical WPs → confirm mapping to outputs (when needed)
But:
👉 Partners should NOT directly edit it without coordination.
👉 Otherwise it becomes chaotic.
