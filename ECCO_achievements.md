1st presentation 

Gaming as a Tool to Exchange Knowledge: HackShield
HackShield is a gaming platform that has been an effective tool for exchanging knowledge over cybersecurity issues in school. The objective is to be introduced to kids in schools to learn about cybersecurity. The junior Cyber Agents are roles in the game which helps children protect their parents and grandparents online. Why Gaming? Gaming provides a safe space where children can make mistakes, learn from them, and see the consequences without real-world repercussions. Regarding accessibility, the platform is free, ensuring that it is accessible to everyone. Regarding educational Integration the platform is friendly for the teachers as it is designed so that lessons can be delivered without any prior knowledge required. Regarding validation, the learning effects, processes, and impacts have been validated and recognized with awards. Finally regarding ease of Access, the platform is easy for students to join and participate in.


The QA session revealed the audience interest on they can we engage and translate to PT/PT and implement the program at the national level. The presenters indicated that in order to reach that goal, adjustments are needed. Collaboration with private entities or government bodies is essential. Working with municipalities, police, and local organizations is crucial. For example, Portugal can run it by leveraging these collaborations. Additionally, a validation report on the process and impact was requested which will be shared through the website with the relevant information.
The audience showed in interest on how they start marketing to children while the Emily explains that they are not a big company like Fortnite, so there was no initial marketing. The strategy involved children communicating with other, supported by police and local organizations. A significant investment of time in community engagement was necessary, taking 4-8 months to reach hundreds and additional months to reach thousands. Parents also prefer educational games so they received a look of good feedback on this.

2nd presentation 
During the second presentation Giorgia Bassi, CNR similarly as the previous game described that it includes also roles (protagonist Nabbovaldo). There are some training courses for the teachers, provided questionnaires and of course there are session at home by the children. The classroom activities are remote supervisioned by the staff of Ludoteca. Finally there was a questionnaire ex-post. Evaluation of the game's impact is conducted via an ex-post questionnaire. The evaluation involved 438 students from six schools in Tuscany, with a gender distribution of 50.9% males and 48.2% females. Notably, 83.8% of the students connect via smartphones, and while 53% have at least one social network profile, only 24% maintain a private profile.
During the QA session Anamaria Magri Pantea involved in a project related to education enhancing Cybesecuriry and future educators and are of course looking for any resources that could be used towards this direction, interested in tools and game as well, asked if both games are available in English and Italian; whether the training program used in class is free and whether several countries could be involved that could be interested.
Giorgia responses that all resources are available in the website which you can download but currently only in Italian. They hope to finish translation soon. 			
Emily notes that the first game is also available in German (will be soon available in Austria)
Stewart Kowalski Norwegian University of Technology, raises concerns from a criminological/ victimology perspective. Whether there are any statistics on this, e.g cyberbullying.  Emily notes that they have partially partly integrated this aspect. She will find material to send.
